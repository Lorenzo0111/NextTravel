### Backend

If you want to selfhost the API, you can use Docker. You can build and run the image by running the following command:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t nexttravel-api -f api/Dockerfile .
# Run the image on port 3000 with the environment variables from .env
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env nexttravel-api
```

The API will usually be available at `http://localhost:3000/`.

### Frontend

The frontend uses React Native with Expo. You can use EAS to build the app for iOS and Android.

```bash
# Install the EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli
# Build the app
eas build
```
